[**The Bachelorette, Season 16 Cast Rankings**](https://a-liawalton.github.io/bachelorette.html)

As a final project for my Web Authoring I class at Seattle Central College, we had to create a website using what we'd learned in the class. This a responsive micro-site that uses media queries, fluid images, and fluid typography to adapt the design for different screen sizes. The cast rankings are formatted into a three-column table that makes use of psuedo-classes for styling cells.
